A single-file library which makes colored terminal output easier.
Written for bash.

Usage:
  
  # Include the lib into your script/console.
  source ./bash_color/bash_color.sh

  # This defines variables and functions in your scope.
  #
  # $CLR_*      varibles contains escape codes for graphics. Think of it like meaningful names for numbers.
  # $CLR_ESC    is a special variable which contains escape byte (\033) plus [ character.
  # 
  # clr_escape  function allows to build custom combinations.
  #               It takes a string and unlimited amount of escape codes.
  #               Those will be applied to string in order, then result will be echoed.
  # clr_*       is shortcut functions to format and output text. See clr_dump for list.
  # clr_dump    outputs nice table displaying available colors.
  # clr_reset   does 'echo -e "\033[0m"' which clears all previously defined formatting.
  # 
  # See examples below.

  # Echoes "foobar" using red foreground.
  clr_red "foobar"

  # green background
  clr_greenb "foobar"

  # cyan bold
  clr_bold "$(clr_cyan foobar)"
  # or
  clr_escape foobar $CLR_BOLD $CLR_CYAN
  # or
  clr_escape foobar 1 36
